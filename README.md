Generate a professional readme.md file fast so you can get back to playing minecraft!

## description
Wanna simplify making a readme.md file for your project? Just download this app to overwrite this readme.md and make a readme.md file for every project you make! And don't even worry about using it multiple times for different projects, because when you run it again, it will overwrite the pre-existing readme.md file again! I know! It's amazing! You're welcome!

## Installation and usage
Simply download the app from github, run npm init in the files root folder, then finally just run node app.js for as many projects as you need!(node not included)
